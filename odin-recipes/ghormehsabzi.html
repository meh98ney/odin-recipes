    The main ingredients are a mixture of sauteed herbs, consisting mainly of parsley, leeks or green onions, and coriander, seasoned with the key spice of dried fenugreek leaves. The herb mixture has many variations.[2] Any dark bitter greens can be used, such as kale, mustard greens, or turnip greens, although none are part of the original recipe.[3]
    This mixture is cooked with kidney beans, yellow or red onions, black lime (pierced dried limou-Amani Persian lime), and turmeric-seasoned lamb or beef. The dish is then served with polo (Persian parboiled and steamed rice) or over tahdig.[4]
